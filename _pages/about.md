# Biography
I was born in New York but grew up in Minnesota. I currently attend Cornell University with a major in astronomy with a concentration in astrophysics and a minor in physics. In my free time, I like to play piano, bass guitar and chess. I'm also an avid reader, enjoying genres from classic literature to science fiction. 

# Research Background
I'm a senior at Cornell University studying astrophysics. I have been conducting research for over two years alongside Professor Nicholas Battaglia and Dr. John Orlowski-Scherer, and more recently, Professor Michael Coughlin. I'm planning to attend graduate school in Fall 2024, with hopes to earn a PhD in astrophysics and eventually work as a research scientist.
