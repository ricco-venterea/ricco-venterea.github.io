# Biography
Hello! I currently attend Cornell University with a major in astronomy with a concentration in astrophysics and a minor in physics. I'm very passionate about astrophysics research and pursuing ideas across disciplines. In my free time, I like to play piano, bass guitar and chess. I'm also an [avid reader](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22822356-ricco?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=currently-reading), enjoying genres from classic literature to science fiction. 

My [academic genealogy](https://academictree.org/physics/faq.php#whatis) includes Millikan, Rabi, Sommerfeld, and Wilkinson. Through Professor Jim Gates, my Einstein number is 6. Just by association, my genealogy would also include Feynman through Professor Gates.

# Research Background
I have been conducting research for over two years alongside Professor Nicholas Battaglia and Dr. John Orlowski-Scherer, and more recently, Professor Michael Coughlin and Will Benoit. I will attend graduate school in Fall 2024, with hopes to earn a PhD in astrophysics and eventually work as a research scientist.

## Current Research Interests
‚òÑÔ∏è Under Professor Battaglia and Dr. Orlowski-Scherer, I have been studying thermal emission flux from asteroids in our solar system. We use data collected by the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://act.princeton.edu/), which has prompted new questions into asteroid regolith, such as the flux discrepancies across infrared and millimeter wavelengths.

üåä Under Professor Coughlin and Will, I have been implementing a novel machine learning algorithm in the context of gravitational waves. We use data collected by the [Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory](https://www.ligo.org/), and I have developed a user-interface for scientists to better understand the distribution of the black hole simulation parameters under this algorithm.

‚ú® Inspired by my high school particle physics teacher, I recently submitted a paper detailing a cosmic ray muon experiment I conducted in high school. Our results constrain the accuracy of [QuarkNet detectors](https://quarknet.fnal.gov/toolkits/ati/fnaldet.html) in high school classrooms, but more importantly, we ask high schoolers to develop their own experiments to help improve detectors and conduct science on their own.
