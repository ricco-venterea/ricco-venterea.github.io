# Biography
I was born in New York but grew up in Minnesota. I currently attend Cornell University with a major in astronomy with a concentration in astrophysics and a minor in physics. In my free time, I like to play piano, bass guitar and chess. I'm also an avid reader, enjoying genres from classic literature to science fiction. 

# Research Background
I'm a senior at Cornell University studying astrophysics. I have been conducting research for over two years alongside Professor Nicholas Battaglia and Dr. John Orlowski-Scherer, and more recently, Professor Michael Coughlin and Will Benoit. I'm planning to attend graduate school in Fall 2024, with hopes to earn a PhD in astrophysics and eventually work as a research scientist.

## Current Research Interests
‚òÑÔ∏è Under Professor Battaglia and Dr. Orlowski-Scherer, I have been studying thermal emission flux from asteroids in our solar system. We use data collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, which has prompted new questions into asteroid regolith.

üåä Under Professor Coughlin and Will, I have been implementing a novel machine learning algorithm in the context of gravitational waves. We use data collected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, and I have developed a user-interface for scientists to better understand the distribtion of the black hole simulation parameters under this algorithm.
