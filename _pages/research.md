I have many interests at this point, but my main focus is in the intersection of planetary science and millimeter astronomy. See below for high level overviews of my research interests. 

## ACTeroids
We are studying thermal emission flux from asteroids collected in millimeter wavelengths (from 1 - 3 mm). 

## Aframe

## QuarkNet
